# Introduction to Python
What you'll learn:
- Using Python in Jupyter Notebooks
- Gathering input and manipulating input/output
- Building reusable Functions with parameters and return values
- Decisions and repetition using conditional statements and loops

After you explore data types and variables, take a look at strings, input, testing, and formatting. From there, learn about arguments and parameters, along with conditionals and nested conditionals. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll be able to create programs that prompt users for input and use conditional (True/False) logic and Python methods to manipulate numbers and text to provide responses to the users, in addition to requesting further input. Plus, learn basic troubleshooting for your code.
